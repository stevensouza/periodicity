Paints.java is a standalone class that displays 
surprisingly complex images with surprisingly simple logic by altering the arguments.  
For example:

java -classpath .  com.stevesouza.surpriseimages.Paints 0
![Example4](https://github.com/stevensouza/periodicity/blob/master/0.png)

java -classpath .  com.stevesouza.surpriseimages.Paints 1
![Example5](https://github.com/stevensouza/periodicity/blob/master/1.png)

You can also simply run the folloiwng and it will show some other possibilities

java -classpath .  com.stevesouza.surpriseimages.Paints
