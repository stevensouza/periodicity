         * This is a Swing program.  JobVisualizer inherits from and is a JPanel/canvas that is written too within a JFrame/Window.

         *
         * With these few instructions we will obtain a window which can be maximize, minimize, change itÂ´s size with the mouse,
         * etc. When we create a JFrame object we start an engine which manages the user interface. This engine communicates
         * with the operative system both to paint in the screen as to receive information from the keyboard and from the mouse.
         * We will call this engine "AWT Engine" or "Swing Engine"
         *
         * JPanel: The canvas
         *
         * To be able to paint we want to know WHERE and where is an JPanel object which will be included in the window.
         * We extend the JPanel class to be able to overwrite the paint method which is the method called by the AWT Engine
         * to paint what appears in the screen.
