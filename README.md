# App that let's you play with periodicity by default where each pixel is 1 hour of the day and 365 days are displayed (24*365)

To run: java -jar target/periodicity-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

This will pull up a command shell and from here you can execute commands.

Then you can enter 'help', 'help <command>'. The main command is 'run' (which also can be invoked with an 'r').  To see a default example just type 'run' followed by a return and an image will display.  Look at the various *.txt files for further examples or type 'fh' (further help) for more information about the program.
